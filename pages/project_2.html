                                Argon Chalice was a group project as a part of the Foundations of Game Design
                                class in SFU’s Interactive Arts and Technology (IAT) program. The team’s goal
                                was to develop a game that follows a standard narrative structure that features
                                a collection of levels that increase in difficulty, followed by a final boss.
                                The game is about Owen, an outdated robot that awakens to a war-torn dystopian
                                future in search of a memory module that contains its memories. It proceeds
                                through a tower where a patrol team is searching to destroy him. After facing
                                and immobilizing its creator, Owen's past reveals that the world and people he
                                once loved are both gone, replaced by a world of war between two organizations
                                known as the World Union and Rouge Faction (Figure 1). The game ends on a split
                                choice Owen makes on which organization he will join. My other 3 team members
                                took up roles with project management, programming, and game designing, which
                                left me in charge of art direction.

                                As art director, this was a fun project to immerse myself into, as there were a
                                few character designs I had in mind to portray the characters and environments.
                                For instance, I wanted Owen and his starting environment to have an outdated look,
                                which would contrast the more modern look of the rogue faction units. To express
                                this contrast further, I gave Owen a warmer colour scheme and the Rogue Faction a
                                colder palette (Figure 2). Additionally, I gave the boss a sinister look to
                                express the superiority of the current world’s Rogue Faction over Owen’s line of
                                robots (Figure 3). The team's original intention was to have the characters
                                animated, but due to time constraints, we prioritized the game’s functionality
                                over aesthetic details. This also led to me reusing certain assets for in-game
                                cutscenes (Figure 4).

                                 One challenge I came across was the fact that I was not as invested in
                                 working with Github and Unity for designing the game, which was the
                                 primary intention of the class. As the team’s graphics illustrator, I
                                 found myself so caught up in producing assets that I would simply
                                 upload assets to Google Drive, rather than passing the learning curve
                                 of working with Github and Unity. This step wasn’t essential since I
                                 was still able to produce the required assets for the game, but it
                                 would have certainly been to my benefit. The other difficulty was
                                 that the class was conducted virtually due to Covid-19. This made
                                 matters challenging when it came time to explain concepts and
                                 creative details, but thanks to the superb management of the team,
                                 these issues didn’t pose a serious issue.

                                  Contrary to my experience with project 1, I had a more positive experience
                                  illustrating for Argon Chalice since each team member had a role that bore
                                  equal weight as my art direction did. Therefore, the work was more equally
                                  distributed since the success of the project did not hinge on my ability to
                                  produce assets quickly. I have a positive reception of this project since
                                  every team member was passionate enough to fulfill their part. As stated
                                  before, I hope to become more involved in learning Unity and Github workflow
                                  in the future, since my role as illustrator prohibited me from doing so.
                                  Becoming sufficient in Github’s workflow will also become essential when it
                                  comes time to share programming-based projects on my portfolio, hence why
                                  I prioritize that skill moving forward.
