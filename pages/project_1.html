                                                            group project as a part of the Narrative and New
                                                            Media class in SFU's Interactive Arts and Technology
                                                            program. Our team's goal was to develop a narrative
                                                            interactive story that featured diverting paths that
                                                            alter the outcome of the story. Our team used Figma,
                                                            the online interaction prototyping software as it
                                                            enabled us to simultaneously work on the project
                                                            together. This story features a cat and mouse who
                                                            have to put their differences aside to escape an endless
                                                            expanse of forest. As the most savvy artist in the group,
                                                            I was assigned the largest role of drawing every panel
                                                            in the story. Our team initially thought of dividing the
                                                            illustration work between two team members. However, we
                                                            ultimately decided against it since assigning two artists
                                                            would've created inconsistencies between art styles. </p>

                                                            into scenes that I would draw. As Figures 6 and 7 illustrate, I start
                                                            with a brief draft sketch to visualize the scene's environment,
                                                            as well as the perspective and placement of characters. From
                                                            there, I finish the drawing by cleaning up the line art, and
                                                            blending colours to give the works more definition, as shown
                                                            in Figures 8 and 9. Next, as evident in Figures 10 and 11, the
                                                            artworks are added as panels in Figma with the respective
                                                            characters and dialogue. On top of the backgrounds, I was tasked
                                                            with drawing the various poses for each character, as shown in
                                                            Figure 5.
