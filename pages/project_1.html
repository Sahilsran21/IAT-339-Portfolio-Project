                                Cat and Mouse: Unbounded Rivalry was a final group project as a part of the
                                Narrative and New Media class in SFU's Interactive Arts and Technology (IAT)
                                program. Our team's goal was to develop a narrative interactive story that
                                featured multiple divergent paths that alter the outcome of the story. Our
                                team used Figma, the online interaction prototyping software, as it enabled
                                us to simultaneously work on the project together. This story features the
                                conflict between a cat and mouse who have to put their differences aside to
                                escape an endless expanse of forest. As the most savvy artist in the group,
                                I was assigned the largest role of drawing every character and background in
                                the story. Our team initially thought of dividing the illustration work
                                between two team members. However, we ultimately decided against it since
                                assigning two artists would've created inconsistencies between art styles.

                                The process began with the script, which would be categorized into scenes that
                                I would draw. As Figures 2 and 3 illustrate, I started with a brief draft
                                sketch to visualize the scene's environment, as well as the perspective and
                                placement of characters. From   there, I finished the drawing by cleaning up
                                the line art, and blending colours to give the scenes more definition, as
                                shown in Figures 4 and 6. Next, as evident in Figures 5 and 7, the artworks
                                are added as panels in Figma with the respective characters and dialogue.
                                On top of illustrating the backgrounds,I was tasked with drawing the various
                                poses for each character, as shown in Figure 1.

                                 One of the biggest problems that I encountered immediately was the sheer
                                 volume of work. With approximately 20 scenes and several character drawings/
                                 expressions, time management and consistency were of the utmost importance.
                                 Therefore, I was forced to spend less time on each drawing and compromise
                                 for low fidelity simply due to a lack of time. With this strategy, I was
                                 able to complete the minimum requirements for the story. Another potential
                                 solution would've been to have a2nd or 3rd artist. However, this would
                                 require the team to use drawing software that supports rigging to streamline
                                 the process of building every scene, in order to maintain consistency
                                 throughout the project. Due to the team's lack of experience and access to
                                 these sophisticated programs, it was ultimately my duty to draw all assets,
                                 for which I used Clip Studio Paint EX.

                                From this experience, I learned that it is sometimes okay to assume a larger role
                                in a team environment if it ultimately benefits the end product. Distributing work
                                equally among teammates is taught in IAT as the most ideal outcome, but that
                                sometimes proves impossible for the nature of projects, where one skill will
                                inevitably outshine the rest. Alternatively, in a professional setting, teams
                                would be specialized to ensure there is an adequate balance of skill sets to
                                ensure each role within the project is fulfilled equally. Due to the nature of
                                team formation within IAT, this simply wasn't the case and ultimately I proved
                                to be the strongest link within the team, which led to completion of the project.
